## Introduction

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game, where players guess the letters of a hidden word. It is built using React for the frontend framework and TypeScript for type safety.

## Features

- Random word generation
- Interactive letter guessing
- Word display with guessed letters
- Remaining guesses counter
- Simple and clean UI

## Demo

You can try the live demo [here](#).

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hangman-react-typescript.git
    cd hangman-react-typescript
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the development server**:

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

    The app should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

1. **Open the game**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Play the game**:
   - Guess letters by clicking on the letter buttons.
   - The game will show the correctly guessed letters in their respective positions.
   - Incorrect guesses will decrease the remaining guesses counter.
   - The game ends when you either guess the word correctly or run out of guesses.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
